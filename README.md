# Full Stack Project Template: Node.js, MongoDB, Express, React

This is a full-stack web application template using Node.js for the backend, Express as the server framework, MongoDB as the database, and React for the frontend. The project is structured for easy setup and deployment, allowing you to quickly build modern web applications.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed (v14 or later is recommended).
- **MongoDB**: You must have MongoDB running locally or use a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.
- **npm** or **yarn**: For managing dependencies.

### Environment Variables

In the root of the project, create a `.env` file for environment variables. Hereâ€™s an example:

```bash
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your_database_name
PORT=5000
```

##Installation

## Clone the Repo

`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-template.git
cd project-template
`

##Backend Setup
1, Navigate to the server directory

`cd server
`

2, INstall backend dependencies

`npm install
`

3,Ensure MongoDB is running, and start the backend server:

`npm run server
`

## Frontend Setup

1, Navigate to the `client` directory:

`cd ../client
`
2, Install frontend dependencies:

`npm install
`

3, Start the frontend React development server:

`npm strart`

## Running the Application

To run both the client and server simultaneously, navigate back to the root directory and run:

`npm run dev
`
This will concurrently run both the React frontend (at `http://localhost:3000` ) and the Express backend (at `http://localhost:5000 `).
